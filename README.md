# WormEvolution
Evolutionary Algorithm for simulating Planaria using BITSEY.

Give the simulation a set of input parameters and the simulation will calculate the fitness of for each worm using BITSEY.
The simulation then takes the best 50% of the population and doubles the population by breeding pairs of worms.
Each pair of worms produces two children with a mixture of their parents' traits and some traits that have undergone mutation.

The goal of this project is to offer researchers a tool with which they can test to see which parameters produce the highest
fitness levels among a population of worms.

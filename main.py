    # charge neutral. Make sure to keep the cell interior pretty close to charge
    # neutral, or else the simulation will explode!
    # For example, if we want to double [Na+], it would go from 10 to 20. We
    # will also increase [Cl] by 10 moles/m^3 to preserve charge neutrality.
    # You should do similar things for the other cells, as per the instructions.

    # Simulation #3 asks you to alter the diffusion constants D_Na, D_K and
    # D_Cl. By default, sim.init_big_arrays() sets all three to 1e-18, and then
